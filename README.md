# Shaik Musharaf – Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I share my projects, skills, and achievements.  
I built it to give recruiters, collaborators, and other developers a quick way to learn about me and the work I've done.

## About the Project
The portfolio is fully responsive, works on all devices, and has a clean UI, modern look.  
It includes smooth animations, theme switching, and sections for:
- My introduction
- Skills
- Projects
- Achievements
- Contact details

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Projects Featured
**FocusVault** – A PWA for study productivity with timers, analytics, and offline support.  
**Collaborative Notes App** – Real-time collaborative notes using Socket.IO and WebRTC.  
I’ve also added smaller projects and experiments I’ve worked on.
